# 1. Load data

Please load the file named 'nhanes.xlsx'

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(table1)
library(kableExtra)
library(gtsummary)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr) 
library(cowplot)
library(rstatix)
library(broom)
library(gt)
library(writexl)
library(NHANES)

df <- read_xlsx("data/nhanes.xlsx")

```

# 2. Select variables

Select the following variables for analysis. ID, Age, Gender,
PhysActive,PhysActiveDays,TVHrsDay, Education, MaritalStatus, BMI,
Pulse, TotChol, DaysMentHlthBad, Depressed,SleepTrouble, SleepHrsNight

```{r}

df <- df %>% 
  select(ID, Age, Gender,
PhysActive,PhysActiveDays,TVHrsDay, Education, MaritalStatus, BMI,
Pulse, TotChol, DaysMentHlthBad, Depressed,SleepTrouble, SleepHrsNight)
```

# 3. Explore data (make character as factor or something like that)

-   Explore the data
    -   Does all variables are correctly identified (factors, numeric
        etc.)?
    -   Do you see any thing that seems unlikely?
    -   Do you see many NA's? (missing data)? What do you think we
        should do with them
    -   Rearrange the data so factors will be factors, and missing data
        will be removed

```{r}
glimpse(df)

new_df <- df %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor),
         across(where(is.double), as.numeric)) %>% 
  select(-TVHrsDay)

str(new_df)

    
```

# 4. summary_by (gender) [mean, sd]

Summarise mean (sd) physical activity days by gender

```{r}
mean_sd <- new_df %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_days = mean(PhysActiveDays, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_days = sd(PhysActiveDays, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

# 5. compute new variable (build a function)

-   Create a function called minus_log10 that calculates the minus of
    the log10 of the Physical Activity days
-   Once created, use it to create a new variable called PhysActDaysLog
-   Following that --\> run it on all numerical variables

```{r}
minus_log10<- function(x){
  y <- -log10(x)
  return(y)
}

df2 <- df %>% 
  mutate(PhysActDaysLog = minus_log10(PhysActiveDays))
  
df3 <- df2 %>% 
  select(-ID, -PhysActDaysLog) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), minus_log10, .names = '{.col}_log'))
```

# 6. Plot

-   Plot Sleep Hours per Night between different marital status
    (boxplot)

    It should look similar to this one ![Boxplot](boxplot.png)

```{r}
glimpse(df3)
sleep_h_marital_boxplot <- df3 %>%
  filter(!is.na(SleepHrsNight), !is.na(MaritalStatus)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=SleepHrsNight, x=MaritalStatus, fill=MaritalStatus ))+
  geom_boxplot()+theme_minimal()
  
  sleep_h_marital_boxplot
  
```

Ok, nice. Now show scatterplot of BMI and Pulse (add BMI as color as
well and see what happens)

should be similar to the following: ![BMI_Color](bmi_color.png)

```{r}
glimpse(df3)
BMI_pulse_scatterplot <- df3 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(BMI_log), !is.na(Pulse_log)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=BMI, y=Pulse)) +
  geom_point()

BMI_pulse_scatterplot

BMI_pulse_scatterplot2 <- df3 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(BMI_log), !is.na(Pulse_log)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=BMI, y=Pulse, colour =BMI)) +
  geom_point()

BMI_pulse_scatterplot2
```

Nice. Now we want you to plot the scatter plot of both BMI and TotChol
with Pulse (i.e., two plot, next to each other, with one showing BMI and
one Total cholesterole)

-   you might need to do something to the data first...

```{r}
glimpse(df3)
df4 <- df3 %>% 
  select(BMI,Pulse,TotChol)

df_long <- df4 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("BMI", "TotChol"), 
               names_to = "Variable",
               values_to = "Value")


```


```{r}
BMI_Totchol_pulse_scatterplot <- df_long %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Pulse), !is.na(Value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Value, y=Pulse, colour =Variable)) +
  geom_point()+facet_wrap(~Variable)

BMI_Totchol_pulse_scatterplot
```

# 7. Table1

-   Build a nice descriptive table of all relevant variables (by gender)

```{r}
df_table <-df3 %>% 
  drop_na()
table1(~ . | Gender, data = df_table)
table
df6 <-new_df %>% 
  select(-ID) %>% drop_na() %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = Gender
  ) %>% 
  add_p() %>% 
  bold_p ()
df6
```

# Statistics (t.test/chisquare)

-   Now, can you test if there is a difference between men and women in
    cholesterol levels?

    -   Choose the correct statistical test and explain the results

    ```{r}
    glimpse(df3)
    
df5 <- df3 %>% 
  mutate(gender=as.factor(Gender)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(gender), !is.na(TotChol))

test <- t.test(TotChol~gender, data = df5)
test
    ```
